# payment-and-withdrawal-frontend

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) frontend for a payment and withdrawal system. It provides a user interface for making payments (integrated with Paystack), saving payment methods, and facilitating withdrawals. Note that the backend logic and services for this project reside in a separate repository.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository and navigate to its root directory. Then, run the development server:

bashCopy code

`npm run dev

# or

yarn dev`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser to explore the payment and withdrawal functionalities.

Development can be started by editing the main page at `pages/index.js`. Your changes will automatically reflect in the browser as you save the file.

Any [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) present can be accessed via [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). To modify this endpoint, refer to `pages/api/hello.js`.

Note: The `pages/api` directory routes to `/api/*`. Files within are recognized as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction), distinct from regular React pages.
